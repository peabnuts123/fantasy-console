# PolyZone

PolyZone is a fully integrated environment to quickly and easily build, share, and play PS1 and N64 style games.

This project is current early in development and is somewhat functional, but lacks a lot of functionality.

A 3D view panel showing a truck on a concrete area surrounded by grass with a road running through it, along with a floating white sphere and a hamburger with a dumpster on top of it - the hamburger object is "selected" and surrounded by a wireframe box showing a control to move the object. An inspector panel showing properties of the currently selected object like "name", "position", "rotation", "scale". An assets panel showing a list of folders titled "models", "textures", "scripts".](media/screenshot.png)
